<h3>Riccardo Alessandri</h3>
<h4>Principal Investigator</h4>

<p>Riccardo was born in Perugia, Italy. 
After his BSc at the University of Perugia, 
he earned his MSc in Theoretical Chemistry and 
Computational Modeling at the University of Groningen,
Netherlands. 
He received his PhD from the University of Groningen in 2019, 
then moved to the U.S. for a postdoctoral
position at the University of Chicago.
In January 2025, he started his own research group as 
an assistant professor at KU Leuven. Riccardo was awarded 
an NWO Rubicon Fellowship, an MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship,
and the Maria Lastra Excellence in Mentoring Award.</p>

<h3>María Ley-Flores</h3>
<h4>(Visiting) PhD student</h4>

<p>María completed a B.Sc. in Materials Engineering at Universidad 
de Sonora. After becoming a Fulbright fellow, she joined the 
Molecular Engineering PhD program at the University of Chicago,
specializing in Materials for Health and Sustainability. She joined
the Alessandri Group as a visiting PhD scholar in January 2025.
María's work focuses on the modeling of polymeric materials
for applications in circular plastics and all-organic batteries.<br><br>

<h3>L. Gonzalo Espinoza A.</h3>
<h4>(Visiting) PhD student</h4>

<p>Originally from Talca, Chile, Gonzalo completed his
undergraduate degree in Bioinformatics Engineering with a
specialization in molecular dynamics. As a PhD candidate, 
he conducts coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate interactions between lipid membranes, nanoparticles, and
membrane proteins. Gonzalo is developing specialized algorithms 
to efficiently analyze and visualize complex molecular 
simulation data.</p>
