<h3>Alireza Mirzaalipour</h3>
<h4>PhD student</h4>

<p>Originally from Iran, he completed both his BSc and
MSc in Polymer Engineering at Amirkabir University of
Technology. During his studies, his research involved
using multiscale simulations, both atomistic and
coarse-grained, along with simulation automation and
force field parameterization to investigate polymeric
amphiphiles and coatings. 
Currently, his PhD (started in the fall of 2025)
focuses on developing a comprehensive
computational framework for the design of innovative
polymers targeting health and sustainable 
applications.</p>

<h3>Besa Mulaj Krasniqi</h3>
<h4>PhD student</h4>

<p>Besa earned a MSc degree in Theoretical Chemistry 
and Computational Modeling (TCCM) in 2025 at Sorbonne 
University with a research internship at KU Leuven. 
Her background is in chemical engineering and physical
chemistry. 
In her PhD (started in the fall of 2025), 
she combines quantum chemistry calculations, 
molecular dynamics simulations, 
and machine learning to model 
organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors.</p>

<h3>Behrad Jandaghian Bidgoli</h3>
<h4>PhD student (co-advised with Prof. Xing Yang)</h4>

<p>Originally from Iran, Behrad holds dual BSc degrees in ChemE and Chemistry from Isfahan University of Technology (2015) and a MSc in Polymer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology (2017). He won gold in the Iranian Chemistry Olympiad and silver in the International Chemistry Olympiad. His master's research focused on hyperbranched polyolefins via chain-shuttling polymerization and DFT simulations of polymerization mechanisms. He then worked as an R&D Engineer at Jam Petrochemical Company, conducting experimental and computational research on catalytic olefin polymerization and polymer rheology. Since February 2024, he has been a PhD candidate in Prof. Xing Yang's group, co-advised by Riccardo, researching electric-field-assisted thin-film composite membranes for resource recovery by means of experiments and multiscale simulations.</p>
