<h3>Alireza Mirzaalipour</h3>
<h4>PhD student</h4>

<p>Originally from Iran, he completed both his BSc and
MSc in Polymer Engineering at Amirkabir University of
Technology. During his studies, his research involved
using multiscale simulations, both atomistic and
coarse-grained, along with simulation automation and
force field parameterization to investigate polymeric
amphiphiles and coatings. 
Currently, his PhD (started in the fall of 2025)
focuses on developing a comprehensive
computational framework for the design of innovative
polymers targeting health and sustainable 
applications.</p>

<h3>Besa Mulaj Krasniqi</h3>
<h4>PhD student</h4>

<p>Besa earned a MSc degree in Theoretical Chemistry 
and Computational Modeling (TCCM) in 2025 at Sorbonne 
University with a research internship at KU Leuven. 
Her background is in chemical engineering and physical
chemistry. 
In her PhD (started in the fall of 2025), 
she combines quantum chemistry calculations, 
molecular dynamics simulations, 
and machine learning to model 
organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors.</p>
